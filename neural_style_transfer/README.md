# Style-Transfer
This folder contains an implementation of the tensorflow and keras version of the neural style transfer proposed by [Gatys et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576). Also, there are some improvements inspired by the paper from [Johnson et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155). The detailed information of this .ipynb notebook can be found on this related [blog](https://eclecticquants2040.wixsite.com/blogs/neural-style-transfer). 

The result folder contains two image examples generated from iteration1 and two image examples generated from iteration10.
