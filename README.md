Projects:
- Complaint Classification bsed on RNN
  - This mini-porject explores using recurrent neural networks for complaint classification. Code is adapted from this [medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-class-text-classification-with-lstm-1590bee1bd17).
  
- Neural Style Transfer based on CNN
  - This mini-project implements the tensorflow and keras version of the neural style transfer proposed by [Gatys et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).
  
- Reinforcement Learning based Portfolio Management for Crypto Currency
  - This mini-project makes use of reinforcement learning in portfolio management. Code is adapted from this [repository](https://github.com/ZhengyaoJiang/PGPortfolio).
