Teammember: Sida Li, Yueyi Sun, Zejiang Shen, Tiantian Wu

The [project website](https://eclecticquants2040.wixsite.com/blogs) contains the blogs for our mini-projects. [Blog1](https://eclecticquants2040.wixsite.com/blogs/multi-class-text-classification),[Blog2](https://eclecticquants2040.wixsite.com/blogs/neural-style-transfer), and [Blog3](https://eclecticquants2040.wixsite.com/blogs/rl-based-portfolio-management) are the blogs for RNN-based Complaint Classification, CNN-based Neural Style Transfer, and Reinforcement-Learning-based Portfolio Management, respectively.

Projects:
- Complaint Classification based on RNN
  - This mini-porject explores using recurrent neural networks for complaint classification. Code is adapted from this [medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-class-text-classification-with-lstm-1590bee1bd17).
  
- Neural Style Transfer based on CNN
  - This mini-project implements the tensorflow and keras version of the neural style transfer proposed by [Gatys et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).
  
- Reinforcement Learning based Portfolio Management for Crypto Currency
  - This mini-project makes use of reinforcement learning in portfolio management. Code is adapted from this [repository](https://github.com/ZhengyaoJiang/PGPortfolio).

Team Contribution: 

- Sida Li is the main contributor of Complaint Classification.

- Yueyi Sun is the main contributor of Neural Style Transfer.

- Zejiang Shen is the main contributor of Reinforcement Learning Portfolio Management.

- Tiantian Wu is the main contributor of proofreading, creation of blogs, and website management.
